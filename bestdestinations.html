          <h2>Tokyo</h2>
          <p>
            Simply setting foot in Japan's cosmopolitan capital is an experience
            within itself. A city known for its bustling streets and flashing
            neon signs, Tokyo has an electric energy and plenty of attractions
            to discover. Foodies won't be let down by the city's fresh sushi and
            hearty ramen. Budding photographers and adrenaline junkies will love
            taking in the sweeping panoramas from the top of the Tokyo Skytree.
            Shopaholics will find plenty of must-have designer products in
            Ginza. And for history buffs, Tokyo offers centuries-old temples and
            shrines to explore.

          <h2>Banff</h2>
          <p>
            An Alberta town full of acclaimed restaurants, breweries, boutiques
            and art galleries, Banff makes for an exciting vacation in every
            season. Vacationers can spend their days hiking, relaxing in hot
            springs and boating on the lakes. Banff's location within the
            Canadian Rockies also makes it easy for visitors to access Banff
            National Park, which boasts some of the world's most beautiful
            vistas. Inside the park, travelers can admire sweeping views of the
            Bow Valley from the Banff Gondola or while schussing the slopes at
            the park's three ski resorts.

          <h2>Bali</h2>
          <p>
            Serene temples and beautiful beaches are the biggest draws to this
            lush Indonesian paradise. And we do mean lush â€“ the region's
            notoriously soggy wet season is best avoided by planning a visit
            between April and October. Break up your beach time with a visit to
            the village of Kintamani, home to a towering (and active) volcano,
            as well as a large lake. If you're craving an adrenaline rush, rent
            a scooter and zip around the island, or hop on one of Bali's many
            swings to soar above rice terraces and jungles.

          <h2>Machu Picchu</h2>
          <p>
            A visit to the "Lost City of the Incas" is not for the faint of
            heart, but it is often described as a life-changing experience (once
            you acclimate to the altitude). While the four-day hike along the
            Inca Trail is challenging, arriving at the Peruvian site during
            sunrise is well worth the effort, according to past travelers. If
            you're not up for the trek, you can also hop on a PeruRail train to
            the mountain base for an easier route to the top.

          <h2>St. Lucia</h2>
          <p>
            Dotted with luxurious boutique hotels, this Caribbean destination is
            tailor-made for lovebirds and adrenaline junkies. Those in search of
            relaxation will find it on the island's unspoiled shorelines
            (specifically Reduit Beach and Anse Chastanet). Meanwhile, adventure
            seekers can test their limits climbing the Pitons or zip lining
            through the Chassin region's rainforest. The dry season, December to
            April, is the most popular (and expensive) time to visit, but
            budget-conscious travelers can find superb weather and cheaper room
            rates if they arrive in May or June.

          <h2>Florence</h2>
          <p>
            Florence offers plenty of world-famous attractions, including the
            Duomo, Piazzale Michelangelo and Piazza della Signoria. Plus, it's a
            haven for art lovers thanks to art-focused museums like the Galleria
            dell'Accademia and the Uffizi Gallery. After appreciating this
            historic Italian city's Renaissance architecture and art, sample
            some of the region's delectable Tuscan food and wine at Florence's
            quaint cafes, gelato shops and ristorantes. Then, cross the Ponte
            Vecchio to get to the acclaimed Pitti Palace and the Boboli Gardens,
            where you'll find fountains, meticulously landscaped green spaces
            and panoramic views.
